            <div class="text-block-5">Last year we built our PigTrailer House, following the theme of reusing and experimenting with recycling materials. This year we want to continue our research and we want to build another example of a “recycled house” that can serve as an inspiration for others to make the most out of the materials we have available. As it will be an experimental house the base to use is still uncertain, but for this project you should be prepared for any kind of materials coming. This challenge will require a certain level of expertise due to the variety of materials we could find.As well as the basic building skills needed such as windows/door installation, panelling, flooring, basic electricity… This can be a project that takes the whole season to make and the goal is to have it finished by the end of the season<br><br><strong>Requirements:</strong> Have some experience/knowledge in the fields above<br><strong>How long:</strong> Minimum 2 months, but ideally longer.<br><strong>When: </strong>Anytime between Mid-March and the end of October.

            <div class="text-block-5">The entire land was fully burned down in 2017, destroying a big part of the native trees. Now what is growing back is basically 1 species, mimosas. A non native invasive tree that grows fast and takes the sunlight for other plants. This makes it in the long term very hard to create a healthy diverse forest life and will have much higher changes for wild fires again in the future. Forest fires are a big challenge in Portugal but we can help to prevent them. We will work with ecologists to analyse the land, create a landscape plan. For years to come.<br><br>⭐️ Reward: Help prevent forest fire, offset your footprint and we name the the forest after you</div>

That said we still need to use a generator for our big machines (3phase). If we want to be really offgrid, run machines, and scale up the community we need to setup ourselves with a better energy infrastructure.  In the coming years we will scale up with four times the amount of people but are simply not equipped for it.

            <div class="text-block-5">Running 100% on renewable energy is a long term goal for us. Easy to achieve for a small household, difficult to achieve with 380V machines like welding and a metal lathe. Is requires a big battery pack, solar panels and a backup like hydro/wind energy for the days without sun. It’s mainly a long term goal because it would take us a while before we have the funds. You can speed this up by providing the capital or sponsoring it.<br><br>⭐️ Reward: We will mention your name/help/company in our videos</div>
